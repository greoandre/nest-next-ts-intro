## Backend

```
For Backend, I use GpraphQL, Prisma, Apollo Server with Simple interaction
How to run the backend?

Go to folder server with command

> cd server-nestjs

Just type this on terminal

> yarn run dev

Then go to

http://localhost:3000/graphql or anything that recommended from terminal
```

## Frontend

```
For Frontend, I use NextJS and still very simple because just moving around from another route
But I but I added a custom 404 page, and title metadata for each page.

How to run the frontend?

Go to folder server with command
> cd client-nextjs

Just type this on terminal
> yarn dev
Then go to
http://localhost:3001 or anything that recommended from terminal
```
